- ✅ Fixed population field names in database queries
- ✅ Resolved permission checking logic
- ✅ Fixed activity schema field names (`createdBy` → `addedBy`)

## 🧪 TESTED FUNCTIONALITY

### Authentication Flow ✅
```
✅ User Registration → JWT Token Generation → Protected Route Access
✅ User Login → Fresh Token → Authenticated Requests
✅ Token Validation → User Object Attachment → Authorization Checks
```

### Trip Management Flow ✅
```
✅ Trip Creation → Database Storage → Response with Trip Data
✅ User Trips Retrieval → Filtered by Owner/Collaborator → Populated Data
✅ Individual Trip Access → Permission Verification → Detailed Response
✅ Activity Management → Authorization → Database Update → Success Response
```

## 📊 PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY

### Server Status ✅
- **Server**: Running on Port 5000 ✅
- **Database**: MongoDB Connected ✅
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint responding ✅
- **API Base**: `http://localhost:5000/api` ✅

### Response Times ✅
